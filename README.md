# TravelNow

## What is this website?
TravelNow is a social media planning website. The purpose of the website is to build a list of places you would like to see when you visit a city. After adding them to your itinerary for the city, they will all be represented on a map. This is so you can see what locations are near eachother and more efficiently plan your trip. If you share your itinerary with a friend, they are able to leave comments about what else you could do while in that city. The itinerary can be updated, changed and deleted as plans change when you are travelling.

The purpose of this website is to store information about the user's current itinerary and travel plans. The user can create an itinerary for any city, and dates they are going. They can add and edit a description of the trip, such as what they did that was fun, or what they are looking forward to. The user can then add locations, by inputing the name, address, website and hours into the form. In their itinerary they can then add these locations to their current trip and the locations will display on the interactive google map available. They can at any point edit their itinerary, locations and selected locations. They can also leave comments on itineraries and delete these comments. If they would like, they can add images from their trip, and delete them if they change their mind. 

## Next Steps: 
- Add search functionality to google, to pull additional information about the selected location. 
- Add ratings to places they visited, or favorite these places. 
- Delete other people's comments off of their itinerary.
- Edit a comment they leave.
